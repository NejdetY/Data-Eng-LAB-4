# Data-Eng-LAB-4
Azure Synapse Analytics Lab

This project is based on the "Explore Azure Synapse Analytics" lab from the Microsoft Learn platform. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to set up, configure, and utilize Azure Synapse Analytics for large-scale data processing, analysis, and querying. Through this project, you will get hands-on experience with key functionalities of Azure Synapse, including data ingestion, analysis using SQL and Apache Spark, and querying through serverless SQL pools.

Key Features

Azure Synapse Workspace Setup: 
The project begins with the creation and configuration of an Azure Synapse workspace. This environment is used to manage data integration and analytics tasks.

Data Ingestion: 
Data can be ingested into the Synapse environment from various sources, including on-premises systems, cloud storage, and more. This project will guide you through uploading and integrating data.

SQL and Spark for Analysis:
One of the main features of Synapse is the ability to analyze data using SQL and Spark. In this project, you'll perform data analysis using both SQL pools for structured data and Apache Spark for large-scale distributed processing.

Serverless SQL Pools: 
A major aspect of this project is leveraging serverless SQL pools for querying data without needing to manage infrastructure. Youâ€™ll learn how to use this feature to quickly analyze data in storage.

Technologies Used

Azure Synapse Analytics: A unified analytics platform that enables data integration, big data processing, and machine learning in a cloud environment.

SQL:
Structured Query Language used for querying relational databases. You'll use SQL pools to analyze structured data.

Apache Spark:
An open-source, distributed computing system that allows for fast processing of large data sets. In this project, you'll use Spark for more advanced data analytics.

Project Workflow

Azure Synapse Workspace Setup:


Create a Synapse workspace in Azure.

Configure necessary services, including data lakes, SQL pools, and Spark pools.

Data Ingestion:

Upload various datasets into the Synapse environment.

Integrate with external sources like Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake.


Performing Data Analysis:

Use SQL pools to perform queries on structured data.

Use Apache Spark for more complex, large-scale data processing tasks.


Serverless SQL Pools:

Query data directly from Azure storage using the serverless SQL pool, without needing to provision dedicated resources.

Setup

To replicate this project in your own Azure environment, follow these steps:

Set up an Azure Synapse workspace in the Azure portal.

Create and configure resources for SQL pools and Spark pools.

Upload datasets to the workspace or integrate data from external sources.

Execute SQL and Spark queries to analyze the data.

Leverage the serverless SQL pool to query data without managing infrastructure.

Usage

You can use the queries and setups provided in this repository to understand how to work with SQL and Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics. Try running these examples in your own Synapse workspace to better understand the data processing workflow. Feel free to modify the queries to fit your own data and business needs.
